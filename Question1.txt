Q1: Conditional Statements
Conditional statements in programming are used to make decisions based on a certain condition or set of conditions. They allow the execution of different code blocks depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false.

if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else if (anotherCondition) {
  // Code to be executed if the 'anotherCondition' is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
}
