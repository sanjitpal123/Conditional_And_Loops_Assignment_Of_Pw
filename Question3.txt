Q3.Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Ans:- Loops are used in programming to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. They help in automating repetitive tasks.

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to be repeated
}

while (condition) {
  // Code to be repeated
}

do {
  // Code to be repeated
} while (condition);


// Example of a for loop
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// Example of a while loop
let count = 1;
while (count <= 5) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
let count2 = 9;

do {
    console.log(count2);
    count2--;
} while (count2 >= 1);
