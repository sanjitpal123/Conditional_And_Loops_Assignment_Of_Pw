Q3.Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Ans:- Loops are used in programming to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. They help in automating repetitive tasks.

    -: Why do we need them:-
     ans:- Loops are essential in programming for several reasons:

  1. Repetition of Code:
   Loops enable the repetition of a specific block of code. Instead of writing the same set of instructions multiple times, you can use a loop to execute the code repeatedly, making the program more concise and 
   easier to maintain.

 2. Efficient Iteration:
    When dealing with collections of data, such as arrays or lists, loops provide a convenient way to iterate over each element efficiently. This is particularly useful for tasks like processing elements, 
      performing calculations, or searching for specific values.

 3. Dynamic Execution:
     Loops allow for dynamic execution based on conditions. The number of iterations can depend on runtime conditions, making the program adapt to changing scenarios.
 
 4.Reduced Code Duplication:
   By using loops, you can avoid duplicating code. This not only makes the code more readable and maintainable but also reduces the chance of introducing errors when making changes.
   
 5.Automating Repetitive Tasks:
   Many programming tasks involve repetitive operations, such as reading files, handling user input, or processing data. Loops automate these tasks, making it easier to manage and maintain the code.
  
  6.Dynamic Data Processing:
    Loops are essential for dynamic data processing. For example, when working with datasets of varying sizes, loops allow you to process data without knowing the exact size of the dataset in advance.
  
  7.Streamlining Control Flow:
     Loops help control the flow of a program by allowing certain parts of the code to be executed repeatedly or skipped based on specified conditions. This enhances the flexibility and control of the program's 
     logic.
  8.  Increased Productivity:
     Using loops leads to more productive and efficient coding practices. They allow developers to express repetitive patterns in a more concise and readable manner.
     In summary, loops are a fundamental concept in programming that facilitates efficient and dynamic execution of code. They are particularly valuable for handling repetitive tasks, iterating over data 
     structures, and automating processes, contributing to the overall readability, maintainability, and efficiency of the code.
      

-:For Loop:-
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to be repeated
}
 -:While Loop:-
while (condition) {
  // Code to be repeated
}
-: Do while loop:-
do {
  // Code to be repeated
} while (condition);


// Example of a for loop
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// Example of a while loop
let count = 1;
while (count <= 5) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
// Eample of do while loop
let count2 = 9;

do {
    console.log(count2);
    count2--;
} while (count2 >= 1);
